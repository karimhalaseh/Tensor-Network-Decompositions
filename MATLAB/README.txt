README FOR:
DecomposeSymmOdecoTensorTrain: A MATLAB method to decompose a symmetric, odeco tensor train satisfying the Decreasing Ranks Condition

Based on the paper "Orthogonal Decomposition of Tensor Trains" (2020) by Karim Halaseh, Tommi Muller, and Elina Robeva, available at:

Before running the script, be sure to install the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB, available at:
https://www.tensortoolbox.org/

runDecomposeSymmOdecoTrain is a script which generates a test problem and calls DecomposeSymmOdecoTrain to decompose it
testDecomposeSymmOdecoTrain is a script generating test problems with varying levels of noise to assess the performance of DecomposeSymmOdecoTrain

After installing Tensor Toolbox, simply click "Run" in MATLAB on runDecomposeSymmOdecoTrain or testDecomposeSymmOdecoTrain
