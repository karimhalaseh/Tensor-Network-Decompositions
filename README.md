# Tensor-Network-Decompositions
Implementation of algorithms in "Orthogonal Tensor Network Decompositions" (Halaseh, Muller, Robeva)

Algorithms for tensor trains of length 2 and Diagonal-Orthogonal-Diagonal Decompositon (DODD) 
(Sections 3, 5, 6 in paper) implemented in Python, with the help of the TensorLy package.

Algorithms for longer symmetric tensor trains (Section 4 in paper) implemented in Matlab (pending).
