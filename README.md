# Tensor-Network-Decompositions
Implementation of algorithms in "Orthogonal Decomposition of Tensor Trains" (2020) by Karim Halaseh, Tommi Muller, and Elina Robeva

Algorithms for orthogonal tensor trains of length 2 and matrix Diagonal-Orthogonal-Diagonal Decompositon (DODD) 
(Sections 3, 5, 6 in the paper) are implemented in Python, with the help of the TensorLy package, and are located in the Python folder.

Algorithms for longer symmetric, orthogonal tensor trains (Section 4 in paper) are implemented in MATLAB, with the help of the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB package, and are located in the MATLAB folder.
